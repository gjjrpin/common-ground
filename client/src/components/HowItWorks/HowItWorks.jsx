        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          "When you click "Get Started", you'll be prompted a statement that you
          can either agree or disagree with. You'll need to keep clicking away
          until you find someone who disagrees with you so much that you just
          have to talk it out.
          <p>
            Think of this like Tinder, but instead of swiping left or right for
            a quick hookup, you're swiping for someone to argue with.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in all seriousness, this app is all about finding common ground
            with someone who sees things differently than you do. With so much
            division in the world, you'd be surprised how many things you'll
            have in common with someone you don't agree with.
          </p>

        <h2>Rules:</h2>
        <p>
          I know what you're thinking... This is going to be very messy. A
          conservative and a liberal in one room? Am I trying to start a culture
          war? Not to worry! I'm using our future AI overlords to moderate the
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenAI (ChatGPT) will read every message sent and checks if the user
          violates any of the rules below. If they do, the AI will warn them
          that they are violating the rules and not allow the message to be sent
          to the other user.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Respect each other: Both parties must show respect for each other at
            all times, even when discussing controversial or sensitive topics.
            Insults, personal attacks, or offensive language are not allowed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Listen actively: Both parties must listen to each other's opinions
            and try to understand their perspective, even if they don't agree
            with it. Avoid interrupting or talking over the other person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stay on topic: Both parties must stay on the topic at hand and avoid
            bringing up unrelated issues. This will help keep the discussion
            focused and prevent it from devolving into a heated argument.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use evidence and reason: Both parties should back up their arguments
            with evidence and reason. Personal opinions are valid, but they
            should be supported by facts and logic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid fallacies: Both parties should avoid using logical fallacies,
            such as ad hominem attacks, straw man arguments, or slippery slope
            arguments. These tactics can derail the conversation and prevent
            productive dialogue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take breaks if necessary: If the discussion becomes too heated or
            emotional, both parties should be able to take a break to cool off
            and regroup before continuing the conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Agree to disagree: If both parties cannot come to an agreement, they
            should agree to disagree respectfully. It is possible to have a
            civil discourse without necessarily changing one's own opinion.
          </li>
        </ul>
